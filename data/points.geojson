Founded by Himansu Rai and Devika Rani after their return from Europe in 1934, it was the only major studio established as a full-fledged corporate body with a board of directors that included prominent business leaders of Bombay. \nRecalling the early history of Bombay Talkies, the Urdu writer Hasan Manto Himansu Rai as an extremely hard working, disciplined idealist. “He laid down the foundations of the Bombay Talkies in such a manner that it would appear as an ideal production house. This is why he selected for his company a spot that was far away from Bombay city.”\n<img src=\"\/data\/1.png\" style=\"width: 300px\"><br>\nQuoted in: Manto, S.

In this context, cinema posters and stills were an attractive way of advertising films. Indeed, by giving the audience an idea of what to expect inside the hall, posters and stills provided a powerful incentive to give in to the cinema habit. J. Stenson, the Entertainment Duty Tax officer of the Report of the Indian Cinematograph Committee stated: “I have noticed many times that boys of 8 or 9 years old loaf about the cinema halls at odd hours of the night. I have personally observed many times that young boys instead of being in bed are always loafing round the theatres looking at the posters and so on, at a time when they should be in bed.” \n<img src=\"\/data\/5_1.png\">\n<img src=\"\/data\/5_2.png\"><br>\nQuoted in: India.

It is the story of a brave Indian girl who sacrificed royal luxury to the cause of her people and country,” but it is also “a spectacular thriller, the first of its kind in India.”\nA viewer of Fearless Nadia remembers: “The single most memorable sound of my childhood is the clarion call of Hey-y-y-y-y as Fearless Nadia, regal on her horse, her hand raised defiantly in the air, rode down upon the bad guys. To us school kids Fearless Nadia meant courage, strength, idealism.”\n<img src=\"\/data\/6_1.png\"><br>\nA viewer of Fearless Nadia remembers: “We were forced to keep ourselves under control everywhere: at work, in the family, faced with out superiors, on the street, there was nowhere we could give full rein to our emotions – apart from the cinema. There we could shout and laugh and cry without it being invasive or embarrassing. Everyone did it. And that is the reason too why the Nadia films were so popular because no other film managed to draw us in as much. Come the end of the film we were completely drained and exhausted. But at the same time there was a magnificent relief, a catharsis.”\n<img src=\"\/data\/6_2.png\">", "url": "https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/Grand+Milk+Center\/@18.9620173,72.8205558,18z\/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x3be7ce137774bacf:0x6019992c638ec379!2sSuper+Plaza+Cinema!8m2!3d18.962068!4d72.821162!3m4!1s0x0:0xf0b672927d4d77c9!8m2!3d18.962068!4d72.8208395" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 72.8205558, 18.9620173 ] } },
